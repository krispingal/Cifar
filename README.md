Experiments on the [Cifar][cifar] datasets using [pytorch][pytorch]. Attempt to recreate the performance of various state of the art 
 image recognition models, and their benchmarking can be viewed in the [Benchmark.ipynb notebook][benchmark_notebook].

It is recommended to run this notebook on a machine with cuda set up, for reasons of speed.
